# MARC PROJECT 1DAW <br> PHP FRAMEWORK & JQUERY


This is a project with a PHP Framework and Js/Jquery.
It is based on a Supplements Page made by me, with a Homepage, Shop, Services, Meet Us, Contact, and Login (login, register, recover_password, cart, favorites). <br>
With this PHP Framework I'm working with controllers, models and views.
